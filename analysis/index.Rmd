This was made using the workflowr package in R.   

*  Easier to build and extend the website using the new tools in the [rmarkdown][] package and [latest RStudio release][rstudio]  

*  Easier to deploy the website with Git and GitHub by only using one branch

These are the projects I am working on during the my rotation in the Stephens lab. Each analysis file is treated like a lab notebook file for future anaylsis of single cell data.


* [Cell cycle single cell data](recreate_cell_cycle_analysis.html)

* [Gilad single cell fastq processing recreation](recreate_giladsinglecell.html)

* [Compare Gilad single cell counts to my analysis](compare_count_data.Rmd)

Continue the Gilad single cell anaylsis:

* [Create gene-x-sample count matrices and annotation file](gene_x_sample_count_matrix.Rmd)
